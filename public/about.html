            <h2>Welcome to HBCU & MSI Initiatives</h2>
            <p>Do you want to earn some extra cash and get industry based experience during your college? Do you see your friends posts about getting external scholarship, and wonder where did they
                apply from? HBCUUSA is a simple yet efficient one-stop platform for all the HBCU and MSI students where you can apply to all the CSR, internship, fellowships programs opened in that specific time. We are dedicated to showcasing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives and providing information about fellowships specifically aimed at students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI). Our platform aims to connect students with opportunities that promote diversity, inclusion, and social impact.</p>
