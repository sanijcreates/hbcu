# HBCUUSA
HBCUUSA is a simple yet efficient one-stop platform for all the HBCU and MSI students where they can apply to all the CSR, internship, fellowships programs opened in that specific time.
We are dedicated to showcasing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives and providing information about fellowships
specifically aimed at students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI). Our platform aims to connect students with opportunities that promote diversity, inclusion, and social impact.

## Our mission
Our mission is to empower students of HBCUs and MSIs by providing access to resources, opportunities, and information about CSR initiatives and fellowships that support their personal and professional development.


## Our Vision
We envision a future where every student, regardless of their background, has equal access to opportunities for growth, success, and positive impact in their communities.
HBCUUSA will be a community for all of those people to learn and grow together.
